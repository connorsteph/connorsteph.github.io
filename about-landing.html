            <h2>What You're Seeing</h2>
            <p>The animated background on the landing page displays the trajectories of a <strong>dynamical system</strong>, integrated forwards in time from a collection of random initial conditions. Points that diverge to infinity are resampled to initial conditions. The previous points slowly fade over time, leaving a temporary imprint as you adjust the parameters that govern the dynamical system. The gentle 'motion' of the system is caused by small oscillating perturbations to the system parameters.</p>

            <h3>The Hénon Map</h3>
            <p>The default system is the Hénon map, which is defined by the iterative equations:</p>
            <div class="math-container">
                $$\begin{align}
                x_{n+1} &= 1 - ax_n^2 + y_n \\
                y_{n+1} &= bx_n,
                \end{align}$$
            </div>
            <p>where $a$ and $b$ are system parameters (typically $a = 1.4$ and $b = 0.3$). This system displays a mix of regular and chaotic trajectories depending on the initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$. Regular trajectories trace out one-dimensional curves (bright lines) on the two-dimensional plane, whereas chaotic trajectories create space-filling curves (broad, fuzzy areas). Playing around with $a$ and $b$, you'll likely build some intuition for how these parameters change the shape of where trajectories collect -- maybe you could even start to guess the values of $a$ and $b$ just by looking at the size and shapes of the trajectories that the system traces out. This might give you the idea that a computer-vision model could be trained to do something like this (and you would be <a href="/projects/poincare.html">correct</a>).</p>

            For a little pizazz I also make $a$ and $b$ dynamic:
            <div class="math-container">
                $$\begin{align}
                a_{n+1} &= a_0 + 0.1 \cdot \sin(0.01 \cdot n) \\
                b_{n+1} &= b_0 + 0.05 \cdot \cos(0.01 \cdot n).
                \end{align}$$
            </div>
            As long as we change the parameters $a$ and $b$ smoothly and slowly, we essentially get an adiabatic process where we observe a slowly shifting steady state set of points.
        </div>


            <h2>Interactive Controls</h2>
            <p>Click "Show Controls" to reveal parameter sliders that let you modify the mathematical constants in real-time. Each system has different parameters that control aspects like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shape and size</strong> of the attractor</li>
                <li><strong>Density and distribution</strong> of points</li>
                <li><strong>Symmetry and orientation</strong> of patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Chaotic vs. regular</strong> behavior</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The "Reset Parameters" button returns each system to its defaults, selected to represent a visually interesting starting point.</p>
