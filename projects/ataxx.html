            <h2>An Interactive Tree Search Demo for Ataxx</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/connorsteph/ataxx_tree_search">Link</a> to github project.</p>

            <p>An Ataxx engine built on the alpha-beta pruning algorithm for minimax search, written in C++ for a graduate course project in the Fall of 2019. Initially just a tree search engine with simple CLI controls to hook into the tournament framework, I've extended the project to include a web server to play Ataxx (against humans or the engine) with point and click controls. The game engine / server can be built in an entirely containerized fashion to make it easier to set up and try. Just clone the repository and run <code>./build.sh && ./run_server.sh</code></p>

            <h3>Ataxx Game Rules</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Players alternate turns moving their pieces</li>
                <li>Pieces can clone (adjacent) or jump (2 squares max)</li>
                <li>Moving converts all adjacent opponent pieces to your color</li>
                <li>Game ends when no moves available</li>
                <li>Most pieces wins</li>
            </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">A screenshot of the webserver in action. To move, click a square and then click again to move to a new location. When playing against the engine, the engine will display the principle variation (current estimate of optimal play) in the right-hand side display.</p>
