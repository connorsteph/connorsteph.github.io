                Protein language models and MSAs are a core component of ML protein structure
                prediction performance, providing crucial hints to models like AlphaFold and ESM
                about inter-residue interactions. Unfortunately for those trying to predict
                structures in mammalian mRNA, RNA MSA's are generally considered to be poor
                sources of RNA structural information, for example they are often shallow due to
                statistical challenges of only having four bases, need to get around the complex
                information structure in intron / exon regions in eukaryotic mRNA, and the need
                to disambiguate conservation due to RNA structure versus downstream statistical
                signal from nucleotides participating in codons.

                In comes chemical probing data, which is a readout from one or more of a family
                of biochemical assays that provide nucleotide-level annotations about RNA
                structure in solution, namely whether a given nucleotide was accessible to be
                reacted with a chemical probing reagent during an experiment. This data provides
                indirect information about the secondary and tertiary structures that an RNA
                adopts in solution, and can be collected en-masse across millions of RNA
                sequences (both synthetic and from the transciptome). This data provides an
                excellent basis for a foundation model of RNA structure, as we demonstrate by
                showing that the embeddings of a model which has learned to predict chemical
                probing data of an RNA from sequence can be easily probed using simple models
                to achieve great performance on various downstream tasks related to RNA structure.
