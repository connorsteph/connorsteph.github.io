## Undergraduate Research

---

### Computational Physics

[‚öõÔ∏è Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry](/projects/q_chem): applying the [variational method](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_method_(quantum_mechanics)#:~:text=In%20quantum%20mechanics%2C%20the%20variational,method%20is%20the%20variational%20principle.>) to estimate ground state properties of exotic molecules (or: why I learned Fortran77 in 2016).

### Computer Vision + Robotics

[ü¶æ Visual Servoing with Humans in the Loop](/projects/visual_servoing): a novel control scheme for simplifying the operation of a high degree of freedom robot arm that uses computer vision to define an intuitive, task-specific control manifold.

## Graduate Research

---

### Machine Learning Theory

[üß≠ Pure Exploration in Bandit Problems](/projects/bandits): how to run an experiment as efficiently as possible when there's no explicit penality for exploration (or: the problem setting that gave us [Hyperband](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560)).

### Machine Learning Applications

[üõ∞Ô∏è Deep Learning for Dynamical Systems Analysis](/projects/poincare): a project with the European Space Agency on using deep learning to analyze data from (potentially chaotic) dynamical systems.

## Industry Research

---

### Machine Learning for Structural Biology

[üß¨ ATOM-1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.13.571579v1): a foundation model which understands the biophysics of structured RNA molecules.
