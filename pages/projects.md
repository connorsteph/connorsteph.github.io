## Undergraduate Research

---

### Computational Physics

[⚛️ Ab initio quantum chemistry](/projects/q_chem): applying the [variational method](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_method_(quantum_mechanics)#:~:text=In%20quantum%20mechanics%2C%20the%20variational,method%20is%20the%20variational%20principle.>) to estimate ground state properties of exotic molecules (or: why I learned Fortran77 in 2016).

### Computer Vision + Robotics

[🦾 Visual servoing with humans in the Loop](/projects/visual_servoing): a novel control scheme for simplifying the operation of a high degree of freedom robot arm that uses computer vision to define an intuitive, task-specific control manifold.

## Graduate Work

---

### Machine Learning Theory

[🧭 Pure exploration in bandit problems](/projects/bandits): how to run an experiment as efficiently as possible when there's no explicit penality for exploration (or: the problem setting that gave us [Hyperband](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560)).

### Machine Learning Applications

[🛰️ Deep learning for dynamical systems analysis](/projects/poincare): a project with the European Space Agency on using deep learning to analyze data from (potentially chaotic) dynamical systems.

### Miscellaneous

[🧮 Ataxx game search engine](/projects/ataxx): my C++ Ataxx minimax search engine that won a graduate heuristic search course tournament.

## Industry Research

---

### Machine Learning for Structural Biology

[🧬 ATOM-1](/projects/atom1): a sequence-to-sequence foundation model for RNA biophysics, and the core of Atomic AI's 3D structure prediction model.
