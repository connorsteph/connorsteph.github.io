## Machine Learning

---

[üß¨ ATOM-1](/projects/atom1): a sequence-to-sequence foundation model for RNA biophysics, and the core of Atomic AI's 3D structure prediction model.

[üß≠ Pure exploration in bandit problems](/projects/bandits): how to run an experiment as efficiently as possible when there's no explicit penality for exploration (or: the problem setting that gave the world [Hyperband](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560)).

[üõ∞Ô∏è Deep learning for dynamical systems analysis](/projects/poincare): a project with the European Space Agency using deep learning to analyze data from (potentially chaotic) dynamical systems.

## Computational Physics & Chemistry

---

[‚öõÔ∏è Ab initio quantum chemistry](/projects/q_chem): applying the [variational method](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_method_(quantum_mechanics)#:~:text=In%20quantum%20mechanics%2C%20the%20variational,method%20is%20the%20variational%20principle.>) to estimate ground state properties of exotic molecules (or: why I learned Fortran77 in 2016).

## Computer Vision & Robotics

---

[ü¶æ Visual servoing with humans in the Loop](/projects/visual_servoing): a novel control scheme for simplifying the operation of a high degree of freedom robot arm that uses computer vision to define an intuitive, task-specific control manifold.

## Algorithms & Games

---

[üßÆ Ataxx game search engine](/projects/ataxx): my C++ Ataxx minimax search engine that won a graduate heuristic search course tournament (by being fast, and spending it's time wisely in the tournament)
